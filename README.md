  ## Installation 
  Installation consists of downloading the zip file, extracting all of the files, and running the server.js through a terminal of your choice. Once you visit the local port, you will be routed to the inital page of the app.

  ## Usage 
  Once the application is running, using the two labelled text boxes is simple. The operator only needs to enter a title and content of note. Once both fields have been populated, a save button will be visible and once pressed, the data is saved and displayed on the left portion of the screen. The plus icon can be pressed to start a new note. Notes that have been entered will persist to keep information present and within view of the user.
